# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently in early development. Security fixes will be released on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for suspected security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability") so we can coordinate a fix before disclosure.

Include:

- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any relevant logs (please redact secrets)
